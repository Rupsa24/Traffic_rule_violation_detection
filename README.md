# Traffic_rule_violation_detection
The number of new vehicles on the road is increasing rapidly, which in turn causes highly congested roads and serving as a reason to break traffic rules by violating them. This leads to a high number of road accidents. Traffic violation detection systems using computer vision are a very efficient tool to reduce traffic violations by tracking and Penalizing. The proposed system was implemented using YOLOV3 object detection for traffic violation detections such as signal jump, vehicle speed, and the number of vehicles. Further, the system is optimized in terms of accuracy. Using the Region of interest and location of the vehicle in the duration of frames, determining signal jump. This implementation obtained an accuracy of 97.67% for vehicle count detection and an accuracy of 89.24% for speed violation detection.
